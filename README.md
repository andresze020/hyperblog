# Hyperblog

First blog for the [Platzi Git and Github course](http://platzi.com/cursos/git-github/ "Platzi Git and Github course")

> This is the course I needed to learn how to work with Git and Github. Then start collaborating on projects!

In this course we cover everything:

- Git commands
- GitHub workflow
- Good practices
- Tips and tricks

As a reminder: **This is not a serious project**. This is just an example. If you got here, I recommend you take the [**course**](http://platzi.com/cursos/git-github/ "Platzi Git and Github course")
